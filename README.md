# SubSense - App Subscription Management Tool

**SubSense** is a smart subscription management tool that helps users **track, analyze**, and **optimize** their app subscriptions. It uses app usage patterns to suggest whether a user should retain or omit a subscription.

## Features

- **Daily Activity Tracking**: Uses a cron job to fetch user activity data every day.
- **Smart Recommendations**: Basic statistical inferences (planned upgrade to ML model) determine if a subscription is underused.
- **Email Reminders**: Automatic email notifications sent at the end of each billing cycle.
- **Spotify Integration**: Currently supports Spotify â€” the only app providing public usage data.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure login and signup with token-based authentication.
- **Responsive UI**: Clean and interactive UI built with Bootstrap and Particles.js.

## How It Works

1. **User Connects Spotify Account**
2. **Daily Cron Job** fetches activity data via the Spotify API
3. **Logic Engine** performs basic analysis to determine usage frequency
4. **Notification System** alerts the user via email if the subscription seems unnecessary

> Future upgrades include a Machine Learning model to enhance decision-making and support for more apps.
